The inspectIT Ocelot Configuration Server is based on the Spring Boot framework which provides a rich set on configuration settings.
There are several ways to customize the server settings according to your needs.

In the following section, we use the approach of using an `application.yml` file to specify the customized settings which is located in the same directory as the server's JAR file.

> Please note that the inspectIT Ocelot configuration server uses the prefix `inspectit-config-server` for its specific inspectIT properties. Up to version 0.4, the prefix `inspectit` was used which has been changed to avoid confusion between the configurations of the different components.

## Configure the HTTP(S) Port

By default, the configuration server uses port 8090 to bind its HTTP endpoints.
This can be changed by setting the `server.port` property to the desired port number.

The following code causes the server to use port `8888`.
```YAML
server:
    port: 8888
```

## Configure SSL 

In order to use SSL encryption for the server's endpoints, the `server.ssl.*` properties have to be configured.
The following properties can be used to configure SSL.

| Property | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `server.ssl.key-store` | The path to the keystore containing the certificate |
| `server.ssl.key-store-password` | Password used to access the key store |
| `server.ssl.key-store-type` | The format used for the keystore. It could be set to `JKS` or `PKCS12` |
| `server.ssl.key-password` | Password used to access the key in the key store | 
| `server.ssl.key-alias` | Alias that identifies the key in the key store (in case the store contains multiple certificates) |

> Currently, it is not possible to use HTTP and HTTPS at the same time. If HTTPS is configured, the server's endpoint will not accept HTTP requests.

The following code causes the server to use the certificate which is mapped to the alias `ocelot` and contained in the key-store `/opt/inspectit/ocelot.p12`.

```YAML
server:
  ssl:
    key-store-type: PKCS12
    key-store: /opt/inspectit/ocelot.p12
    key-store-password: my-keystore-secret
    key-alias: ocelot
```
